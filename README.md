migrate.py
==========

The migration script (`migrate.py`) has incorporated help, so using
`--help` you can see all the options.


Runtime pre-requisites
----------------------

The main requisite is **Python 3.7**. You'll also need to install
the dependency packages:

```console
$ python3.7 -m venv .venv
$ . .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) $ python3.7 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Migration scenario
------------------

The script takes a scenario as a mandatory argument
(`-s path/to/dir`), a scenario is a directory with one or more YAML
files that describe the collection layout post migration.

Each file name is the namespace of the included collections, inside
you can have a collection name, followed by the plugin types and
actual plugin files (with extensions) in that collection as they
appear in the ansible repo, including subdirectories from their
expected locations. For example:

```yaml
# test_scenario/microsoft.yml
azure:
  module_utils:
  - azure.py
  - azure_rm.py
  modules:
  - cloud/azure/azure_rm_instance.py
windows:
  lookups:
  - win_registry.py
```

Some existing scenarios are already provided in the repo, `bare` and
`minimal` being the most useful ones as they can generate (with `-m`
option) an ansible repo w/o most of the plugins (`bare` has none,
`minimal` has the ones we have considered Ansible requires to
minimally function).


Performing the migration
------------------------

In order to run the migration based on the existing scenario, you'd
need to execute somehting like this:

```console
(.venv) $ python3.7 -m migrate -s scenarios/minimal
```


Generating a bare scenario
--------------------------

Another useful script is `generate_glob_collection.sh` which outputs
a YAML structure to stdout that lists ALL the plugins from an Ansible
checkout (which is the only required parameter), useful to regenerate
the `bare` scenario or as a starting point for other scenarios.


Note: scenarios support 'informative' collections, that start with `_`
as a means to let collections know dependencies but not actually
migrate, also the special `_core` collection is used to indicate
plugins that would stay in core and not require rewrites for those
referencing them.
